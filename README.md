## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to get my environment up and running in no time:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ypedroo/my-env.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository folder.
    ```bash
    cd my-env
    ```

3. Make the setup script executable.
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ```

4. Run the setup script.
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

And voila! Your environment should be up and running with my favourite configurations and tools.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Enjoy your new environment! 🎉
